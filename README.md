# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# your-movie-hub-client
Yout movie hub is a MERN app that allows the user to navigate the movie world. the server-side uses the https://www.themoviedb.org/ API for the movie information, mongoose, and MongoDB to store data and express.js and node.js, also using the JWT for user auth between the frontend and the backend. The front end is built on react using userRef, useEffect, useState as well as some custom hooks like query parameters to further improve the user experience.
the idea behind this app is to enable the user to make a playlist for whatever occasion they deem necessary and make it easy for them to find the movie as well as where to watch it. bringing people closer together. 
In the future, the app is going to have a feature to allow users to mark movies as watched, upload images as well as messages, and more!

# friday29
Took the day to do research about user auth, the API I wanted to use as well as the look and feel I wanted for the page.

# Saturda30
Made all the backend for user auth, using express mongoose, jwt, and cors; made the movie feature to add movies, edit movies, and delete movies;


# Sunday
Started the frontend frames; made the movie grids; started to work on the API calls, learned about superagent, met MVP,

# monday
Due to the side effects of my medication was not able to get much done aside from some styling;

# Thuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday:
Pretty much the same as Monday did some styling but not much done

# Friday:
Had to focus on getting stuff done, still experiencing side-effects but started to feel the pressure from the deadline approaching; started to work more on the backend and ran into a lot of bugs, due to the lack of work during the week had to make compromises in the features I wanted to add to the app. started to work more in the API calls, worked on the styling for the individual movie page;

# satuday
Worked all day to get the movie layout done, and added the deleted feature to the app. worked on getting the playlist to modify in real-time. added the cast and crew and similar movies


# sunday
added the recommended movies, made the playlist show page, and made the function to get the movie trailer.
